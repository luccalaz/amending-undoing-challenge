Starting from the provided GitHub repo, your challenge is to:

- Reset the `styles.css` file to remove the `h1` styles previously added.
- Restore the `index.html` file to remove the `h1` and paragraph previously added, without changing the commit history.
- Amend your latest commit with your changes, ensuring the commit message describes the undone edits.

Note: to avoid confusion with the git graph's state at the end of the challenge, it is recommended you uncheck "show remote branches" in git graph or remove the remote by running `git remote remove origin` before starting.
